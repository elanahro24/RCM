# RCM
This repository contains CAD files (.stl) for reproducing a Remote Center of Motion device. 

The design is based on carrying a handheld Bioptigen Retinal OCT Probe. The parts that can be directly printed using any printing service by uploading the .stl files. Below is a list of the additional purchased components.

All dimensions and intended hardware are metric. The links making up the RCM are assembled using rotary shafts (all 4mm diameter). The parts are dimensioned to allow for PTFE washers between any two moving surfaces to reduce friction. The shaft holes in the CAD are undersized to 3.8mm, final diameter should be drilled and reamed to minimize backlash. Link3 and Link4 have holes intersecting each shaft hole for set screws to increase friction if desired.

Additional Components:
1. Velmex A2509H1-S2.5 Linear Slide with 1mm/rev lead screw
2. Newport M-TP-36 grid plate
3. Newport M481-A-S Rotary stage
